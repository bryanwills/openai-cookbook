    "## Building a Scalable Agentic Solution with Object-Oriented Principles  \n",
    "Designing scalable LLM solutions goes beyond simply leveraging powerful models—it also requires application code that is easy to maintain, extend, and modify as requirements evolve. By applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, we can build modular, testable systems that scale alongside changing demands. This Cookbook demonstrates how to develop an OOP-based application using OpenAI’s Chat Completions API, highlighting key design techniques such as inheritance, interfaces, dependency injection, and the factory pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Overview of Our Objective  \n",
    "In Object-Oriented Programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects that model real-world entities, bundling data with associated behaviors. In this Cookbook, we will build a WeatherAgent class. By instantiating a weather_agent object, we can represent an agent that checks the weather for a given ZIP code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "weather_agent = WeatherAgent()\n",
    "\n",
    "result = weather_agent.task(\"What is the weather in 90210 right now?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Agent response:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These three lines demonstrate everything your application code needs to know about the WeatherAgent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiate the agent.  \n",
    "2. Call the task method to handle a user request.  \n",
    "3. Retrieve and use the result.  \n",
    "4. Ask a follow up question, in a stateful manner (ChatCompletions API is stateless).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In an enterprise environment, you could have multiple agents. Once each Agent Class is developed and tested, it can be reused across different applications. This agent-based architecture is designed to be both modular and scalable, while also hiding implementation details within the class definitions and their interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Signature  \n",
    "\n",
    "The WeatherAgent class provides a static method called signature(). This method lets developers quickly see the agent’s capabilities without having to instantiate it. Static methods belong to the class itself, so you do not need to create a class instance to call them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(json.dumps(WeatherAgent.signature(), indent=4))\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",

    "                    \"required\": [\n",
    "                        \"zipcode\"\n",
    "                    ]\n",
    "                }\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite Knowledge  \n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to brush up on your knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Briefly, OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to represent real-world entities and their interactions. The key design principles (often referred to as SOLID principles) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one responsibility.\n",
    "2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n",
    "3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.\n",
    "4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\n",
    "5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented language, and you can learn more about it [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, let’s dive into the details of the solution."

    "### Overview of Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is provided in the directory `./object_oriented_agents/` you can examine the code to follow along. For brevity, this Cookbook will focus on the overview of the architecture and a concrete implementation for demonstration purpose. The code is organized into the following directories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Core Classes: Form the basis of the application and provide a common interface for all agents, tools, and messages. \n",
    "- **BaseAgent**: This is the base class for all agents. It provides a common interface for all agents to follow.\n",
    "- **ToolInterface**: The interface definition for all tools. It provides a common interface for all tools to follow.\n",
    "- **ToolManager**: The tool manager that registers a given tool with an Agent. \n",
    "- **ChatMessages**: A message dictionary that stores the messages for a given conversation. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Services: Provide a common interface for language models. A language model interface is required for the agent to invoke LLM API. \n",
    "- **LanguageModelInterface**: This is the interface for all language models. It provides a common interface for all language models to follow.\n",
    "- **OpenAILanguageModel**: This is a concrete implementation of the LanguageModelInterface that uses the OpenAI Chat Completions API.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Utils:\n",
    "- **Logger**: This is the logger for the application. It provides a common interface for all logging to follow.\n",
    "- **OpenAIClientFactory**: This is the factory for the OpenAI client. It returns an instance of the OpenAI client. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Associations and Dependencies\n",
    "- BaseAgent, ToolInterface, and LanguageModelInterface are abstract classes meant to be extended for specific use cases.\n",
    "- BaseAgent composes a ChatMessages instance for managing conversation logs (i.e., storing and retrieving messages).\n",
    "- BaseAgent optionally holds a ToolManager but always requires a LanguageModelInterface.\n",
    "- ToolManager maintains a set of ToolInterface implementations, uses ChatMessages for context, and delegates API calls to the language model.\n",
    "- OpenAILanguageModel relies on OpenAIClientFactory for client creation, ensuring a clean separation of concerns around API-key resolution and client configuration."

    "2. Define the `run()` method, which executes the tool using the provided arguments and returns the result as a string.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The tool definition for the LLM tool call and the implementation of the tool execution is wrapped in the same class for maintainability. In step 2, we will use the **ToolManager** class to register the tool with the agent. Note that once a tool such as **CheckWeatherTool** is defined, it can be registered with multiple agents to use.

    "### Key Design Principles for Object-Oriented Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Abstraction & Interfaces\n",
    "- Abstract classes (BaseAgent, ToolInterface, LanguageModelInterface) define clear contracts, making it easy to swap in new implementations—such as different language models or tools—without disrupting existing code.\n",
    "- This flexibility is key to building scalable, future-proof systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulation & Single Responsibility\n",
    "- Each class is designed around a specific concern:\n",
    "- ChatMessages manages message storage and manipulation.\n",
    "- ToolManager handles tool registration, definitions, and invocation logic.\n",
    "- BaseAgent orchestrates user tasks, message flow, and the interactions between the language model and tools.\n",
    "- OpenAILanguageModel encapsulates direct communication with the OpenAI API.\n",
    "- Following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ensures that classes remain focused, maintainable, and easy to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dendency Injection & Inversion\n",
    "- Dependencies (e.g., LanguageModelInterface, logging utilities, ToolManager) are passed into constructors or provided through interfaces, preventing rigid coupling to concrete implementations.\n",
    "- This design aligns with the Dependency Inversion Principle, where high-level modules (BaseAgent) depend on abstractions (LanguageModelInterface) rather than concrete classes (OpenAILanguageModel).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Factory Pattern\n",
    "- OpenAIClientFactory centralizes client creation, including any logic for API keys, environment variables, or other configuration details.\n",
    "- By encapsulating client instantiation, you can easily adjust how clients are created without scattering changes throughout the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Separation of Concerns\n",
    "- Responsibilities for tool invocation, message handling, and external API communication are each isolated within their own classes.\n",
    "- This separation yields a system that is straightforward to maintain, debug, and extend over time—an essential trait in scalable architectures."
