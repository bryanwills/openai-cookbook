    "## Building a Scalable Agentic Solution with Object-Oriented Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing scalable LLM solutions requires more than just raw performance of the models — it also demands code that is easy to maintain, extend, and modify as requirements evolve. By leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, we can create modular, testable systems that will stand the test of time. This Cookbook walks you through an OOP-driven implementation for OpenAI’s Chat Completions API, using design techniques such as inheritance, interfaces, dependency injection, and the factory pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is provided in the directory `./object_oriented_agents/` you can examine the code to follow along. For brevity, this Cookbook will focus on the overview of the architecture and a concrete implementation for demonstration purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Base Classes Through Inheritance\n",
    "- BaseAgent, ToolInterface, and LanguageModelInterface are abstract classes meant to be extended for specific use cases.\n",
    "- OpenAILanguageModel is a concrete class implementing LanguageModelInterface, providing a bridge to the OpenAI Chat Completions API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Key Associations and Dependencies\n",
    "- BaseAgent composes a ChatMessages instance for managing conversation logs (i.e., storing and retrieving messages).\n",
    "- BaseAgent optionally holds a ToolManager but always requires a LanguageModelInterface.\n",
    "- ToolManager maintains a set of ToolInterface implementations, uses ChatMessages for context, and delegates API calls to the language model.\n",
    "- OpenAILanguageModel relies on OpenAIClientFactory for client creation, ensuring a clean separation of concerns around API-key resolution and client configuration.\n",
    "\n"

    "### OOP Best Practices in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Abstraction & Interfaces\n",
    "- Abstract classes (BaseAgent, ToolInterface, LanguageModelInterface) define clear contracts, making it easy to swap in new implementations—such as different language models or tools—without disrupting existing code.\n",
    "- This flexibility is key to building scalable, future-proof systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulation & Single Responsibility\n",
    "- Each class is designed around a specific concern:\n",
    "- ChatMessages manages message storage and manipulation.\n",
    "- ToolManager handles tool registration, definitions, and invocation logic.\n",
    "- BaseAgent orchestrates user tasks, message flow, and the interactions between the language model and tools.\n",
    "- OpenAILanguageModel encapsulates direct communication with the OpenAI API.\n",
    "- Following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ensures that classes remain focused, maintainable, and easy to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dendency Injection & Inversion\n",
    "- Dependencies (e.g., LanguageModelInterface, logging utilities, ToolManager) are passed into constructors or provided through interfaces, preventing rigid coupling to concrete implementations.\n",
    "- This design aligns with the Dependency Inversion Principle, where high-level modules (BaseAgent) depend on abstractions (LanguageModelInterface) rather than concrete classes (OpenAILanguageModel).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Factory Pattern\n",
    "- OpenAIClientFactory centralizes client creation, including any logic for API keys, environment variables, or other configuration details.\n",
    "- By encapsulating client instantiation, you can easily adjust how clients are created without scattering changes throughout the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Separation of Concerns\n",
    "- Responsibilities for tool invocation, message handling, and external API communication are each isolated within their own classes.\n",
    "- This separation yields a system that is straightforward to maintain, debug, and extend over time—an essential trait in scalable architectures."
