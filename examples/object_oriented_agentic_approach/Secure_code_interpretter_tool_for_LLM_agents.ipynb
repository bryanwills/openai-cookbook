    "## Building an Agentic Application with Dynamically Generated Tool Calling\n",
    " \n",
    "Function or tool calling is a powerful feature of LLMs that allows the LLM to call a function with arguments. This is a powerful way to extend the capabilities of LLMs to perform complex tasks. Typically, the function is defined by the developer and passed to the LLM as part of the prompt. The developer needs to pre-define the function, its arguments, and the expected output. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In context of this Cookbook, **Dynamically Generated Tool is a function or code block that is generated by the LLM itself at runtime based on the user's prompt**.  This is a powerful way to extend the capabilities of LLMs to perform complex tasks, where the developer does not need to pre-define the function thus constraining the LLM's ability to set of pre-defined scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this paradigm, **Dynamically Generated Tool Calling is giving the LLM ability to dynamically generate and execute a code block at runtime.** \n",
    "\n",
    "This Cookbook demonstrates how to implement an “agentic” application — one that can generate and execute a tool call in pursuit of a specified goal at runtime. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI o1 can generate sophisticated code, making them highly valuable for tasks such as AI assisted programming. We'll use this capability to generate function code for dynamic tools that can be executed in an isolated sandbox environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such an dynamic approach can be applied to a wide array of tasks, including: Data analysis and Visualization, Data manipulation and Transformation, Generating and Execution Machine Learning workloads, Process automation and Scription, ... and many more that will emerge as we experiment with this dynamic tool calling framework. \n",

    "1.\tSet up an isolated Python code execution environment using Docker\n",
    "2.\tConfigure your own code interpreter tool for LLM agents\n",
    "3.\tSetup a clear separation of Agentic concerns for security and safety\n",

    "#### Step 1: Set up an isolated Python code execution environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a secure environment where our LLM generated function calls can be executed. Given the word of caution, we want to avoid directly running the LLM generated code on the host machine. We will use a Docker container environment with restricted resource access (e.g., no network access). By default, Docker containers cannot access the host machine’s file system, which helps ensure that any code generated by the LLM remains contained. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within this container, we will preconfigure the necessary tools and libraries for data analysis and visualization—namely Python and commonly used Python libraries. This container can also be setup for task specific requirements such as access the an internal database for read-only access, or machine learning libraries such as Pyspark, Pytorch, Tensorflow, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Define and Test the Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's fitst answer the question \"**What is an Agent?**\" before we define our agents. In the context of this Cookbook, an Agent is:\n",
    "1. Set of instructions for the LLM to follow, i.e. the developer prompt\n",
    "2. A LLM model, and ability to call the model via the API \n",
    "3. Tool call access to a function, and ability to call the function \n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, we will define two agents. \n",
    "1.\t**Agent 1: File Access Agent (with Static Tool Calling)**\n",
    "- Instructions to understand the contents of the file to provide as context to Agent 2.\n",
    "- Has access to the host machine’s file system. \n",
    "- Can read a file from the host and copy it into the Docker container.\n",
    "- Cannot access the code interpreter tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\t**Agent 2: Python Code Generator and Executor (with Dynamically Generated Tool Calling)**\n",
    "- Recieve the file content's context from Agent 1.\n",
    "- Instructions to generate a Python script to answer the user's question.\n",
    "- Has access to the code interpreter within the Docker container, which is used to execute Python code.\n",
    "- Has access only to the file system inside the Docker container (not the host).\n",
    "- Cannot access the host machine’s file system or the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation concerns of the File Access (Agent 1) and the Code Generator and Executor (Agent 2) is crucial to prevent the LLM from directly accessing or modifying the host machine. **Limit the Agent 1 to Static Tool Calling as it has access to the host file system.**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Agent | Type of Tool Call | Access to Host File System | Access to Docker Container File System | Access to Code Interpreter |\n",

    "| Agent 2: Python Code Generator and Executor | Dynamic | No | Yes | Yes |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Set up Agentic Orchestration to run the application \n",
    "There are various ways to orchestrate the Agents based on the application requirements. In this example, we will use a simple orchestration where the user provides a task and the agents are called in sequence to accomplish the task. The overall orchestration is shown below:\n",
